#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Runs one script-semantics probe on the retail 1.1d Linux dedicated server
# (1.5b with COD_VERSION=1.5) and prints what it logged, for the A/B in
# crates/gsc/tests/semantics_ab.rs.
#
# A probe is a gametype script in crates/gsc/tests/fixtures/semantics/. This
# installs it (plus the one-line .txt description the engine demands) into the
# server homepath, boots the server on a map long enough for the script to run,
# and prints every `PROBE ` line out of games_mp.log with the engine's leading
# timestamp stripped.
#
# `logPrint` is the only channel a dedicated server with no clients shows:
# `print` and `println` produce no console output even with developer 1, and
# `iPrintLn` needs a client. A script runtime error takes the whole server
# down, so a probe that dies mid-run is itself a measurement: the tail of the
# console log holds the error, and this prints it.
#
#   COD_DIR          game install, the directory containing main/ (required)
#   COD_VERSION      1.1 (default), 1.5 or uo, as tools/run_server.sh takes it
#   COD_LNXDED       server binary (default private/reference/cod-lnxded-1.1d/cod_lnxded,
#                    cod-lnxded-1.5b/cod_lnxded for 1.5)
#   COD_LNXDED_HOME  homepath holding main/game.mp.i386.so (default private/server,
#                    private/server-1.5 for 1.5)
#   PORT             UDP port (default 28970, clear of run_server.sh's 28960)
#   SECS             how long to let the server run (default 25)
#   PROBE_SECS       alias for SECS, so a recipe can name either
#
#   tools/run_probe.sh <probe-name> [map] [+set cvar value ...]
#     probe-name may carry a subdirectory (client-probes/probe_trigger); the
#     gametype is installed under the basename either way.
#     map defaults to mp_pavlov; anything after it is passed to the engine
#     verbatim, the way run_server.sh does. The persistence probes need
#     `+set sv_mapRotation "gametype <probe> map mp_pavlov map mp_pavlov"`,
#     which is why the pass-through exists: a probe that ends the map has
#     nothing to load next without it.
